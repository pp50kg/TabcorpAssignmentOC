Deign pattern:MVVM it's easy for uinit test.

The architecture:

1.Views -> ViewControllers only remote the UI flow.

2.ViewModel -> Data process including sort,group.

3.Presenter -> Data binding & request data.

4.Manager -> rebuild a tool with block for networking.

5.SubViews -> Cell or uiview.

6.Data transfer by delegate. it's easy to control,and easy to read.
